		<p>Me and a boy were talking about some real shit<br>
        I mean hard shit<br>
        Like how he wanted to die<br>
        And he said, stop it, you’re making me cry<br>
        I said, what’s wrong with that<br>
        He said, everything<br>
        I said, name one thing<br>
        He told me two<br>
        I am not a girl, and I am not a baby<br>
        I thought, there it is<br>
        The tough-love line we hear from our mothers<br>
        We tell our best friends and we tell our little brothers<br>
        But as often as we say it, it’s still a lie<br>
        Just three words: boys don’t cry<br></p>
        <p>He said, it’s like<br>
        You prove you’re a boy when you prove what you’re not<br>
        Well I got caught a lot so I got taught that you cannot walk like, talk like, fight like, write like, dress like a girl, or you’re less like a boy<br>
        And more like someone who ought to get beat up<br>
        Then he shrugs his shoulders, like I don’t make the rules, but I don’t fuck with fools who don’t know the way to avoid getting called a bitch is to not get emotional in the first place<br>
        It’s the first taste of the pace of the ways we embrace the violence that we think is our best protection<br>
        Like flexing<br>
        I’ll roll up the heart on my sleeve to show you the scar I believe you know where this one is from<br>
        That fight where I fought where I might have not been quite so quick to fit this fist like a fix for that first taste of violence<br>
        But I had to<br>
        There’s too much to lose<br>
        And boys gotta prove what we’re not<br>
        So I’ll bluff like a blackjack callback past the fact that this mask is an act and that’s all it ever was<br>
        And stop talking like I’ve got tears in my eyes<br>
        Cause I’m not a girl and boys don’t…yeah</p>
        <p>He said, there’s one other thing you should understand<br>
        It’s that every young boy wants to be a man<br>
        There’s a presence of lessons in adolescence<br>
        Like when my grade school grad class asked<br>
        What do you want to be when you grow up<br>
        And my only answer was, honestly? Big<br>
        It’s important to recognize, because they don’t just tell you that boys don’t cry<br>
        They say big boys don’t, and then they say you’re big or your worthless<br>
        So I know it’s worth this so I hold this surface tension attention prevention let me be real clear the only thing I’m getting off my chest is a bench press<br>
        What makes a man, muscle<br>
        We’re taught to forget that the heart is a muscle too<br>
        Like I’ll become man enough to withstand enough understand that my hands are commanding enough so I show up with fists so I grow up like this split lip bullshit hit me anywhere you want just don’t acknowledge my feelings<br>
        And when I’m that man I won’t still wonder why<br>
        The first thing I learned is that boys…you get it</p>
        <p>I said, yeah I get it, I’m also a guy<br>
        But listen I’m telling you every boy cries<br>
        It’s a fact, right, but you act, right<br>
        If nothing else wear your mask right<br>
        But it’s like this you start you can’t fight this apart and you gotta let somebody else in your heart, I mean real shit, hard shit<br>
        Trust them and be who you are, quit<br>
        Pretending that this isn’t sad<br>
        Or that it doesn’t matter<br>
        You matter<br>
        That’s not poetry, that’s a full sentence<br>
        So when you say stop it you’re making me cry<br>
        You decide to try to lie to hide deny the inside your implied pride is leading to the biggest killer of boys and young men<br>
        Suicide<br>
        That comes from somewhere<br>
        Which brings me back to that tough love line we heard from our mothers<br>
        We told our best friends and we told our little brothers<br>
        But as often as we said it, it was always a lie<br>
        Let’s change just one word, boys do cry</p>

		<p>I want to start with an image<br>
        There’s a boy, who’s twelve, and he’s crying<br>
        I’ve got a lot inside, there’s pain, grief, loneliness, anger<br>
        And I can’t hold it all, so I slam my fist into a wall<br>
        She grabs my hand without a doubt<br>
        Like somehow she will figure out what to say<br>
        From the lines in my palm<br>
        I imagine her reading my future like this is the map to manhood<br>
        Well your love line is really long, so you’re going to hit a lot of women<br>
        Not just the wall<br>
        The she folds my fingers and kisses my fist<br>
        Not the tears on my cheek<br>
        Like this is what’s hurting, not this</p>
        <p>And I want you to hold that image inside while I tell you about how I lost my best friend when I was five<br>
        We were just playing<br>
        I knocked him down, he hit the ground and didn’t make a sound until I heard a teacher say are you okay, and he whispered, I want Jonathon<br>
        And I felt good, because my best friend needed me<br>
        So I reached down and lifted him up and he punched me as hard as he could in the stomach<br>
        Can you imagine what that felt like?<br>
        It felt like an ocean wave slamming against me<br>
        An entire tide of salt water rising behind my eyes<br>
        Because I was surprised, I didn’t know this guy<br>
        This boy who couldn’t cry, how did we come to this<br>
        That he would need his fist more than he needed me</p>
        <p>Well that’s what we teach our boys<br>
        Don’t cry, toughen up, be a man<br>
        What are you, some kind of faggot<br>
        You pussy, you going to go home and cry about it<br>
        Come on, don’t be a bitch<br>
        Walk it off, rub some dirt in it<br>
        Be a good soldier<br>
        Like post-traumatic stress disorder<br>
        Do you think it’s a coincidence that if they hold it inside then they suicide<br>
        It’s not<br>
        It’s dangerous as hell and it’s what we teach our boys<br>
        Be a man</p>
        <p>When I was ten, I fell playing basketball<br>
        I still remember the blurry eyes, bloody arms<br>
        And the teacher who looked at me and said<br>
        Battle scars<br>
        Fuck that<br>
        Cause I don’t need to be a hero<br>
        I need a hug<br>
        Cause the future seems bleak when you can’t be weak<br>
        When you need to wear this mask like it’s your only task<br>
        Be a man</p>
        <p>When I was thirteen I was in the park<br>
        And a boy fell learning to ride his bike<br>
        His dad said, come on son, get up, don’t be a wimp<br>
        Well I didn’t know his name but I knew his shame <br>
        Because he didn’t say it<br>
        But the look in his eyes was just as loud<br>
        He wanted to make his dad proud<br>
        So he blinked and did the only thing he knew how<br>
        He stood up<br>
        So congratulations son, take a bow<br>
        You’ve learned the act just like my best friend when I was five<br>
        Be a man</p>
        <p>And if you’re listening to this thinking but it’s for the best we make them stronger<br>
        You’re wrong<br>
        I know a boy who cut himself so many times his blood vessels stopped healing properly<br>
        And I’m sorry if that’s not poetic but it’s not fucking poetic<br>
        Strong is not invincible<br>
        Weak is not invaluable<br>
        So you have the choice<br>
        Tears on a cheek or a closed fist missed opportunity for what we could have been<br>
        I want you to imagine that you have the chance to reach out and hold my best friend right before that ocean wave hits<br>
        To open his hand and read new lines to manhood <br>
        For my sake and for the sake of any boys listening to this<br>
        I hope your kiss tastes like saltwater</p>
