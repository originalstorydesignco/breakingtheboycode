		<p>Me and a boy were talking about some real shit<br>
        I mean hard shit<br>
        Like how he wanted to die<br>
        And he said, stop it, you’re making me cry<br>
        I said, what’s wrong with that<br>
        He said, everything<br>
        I said, name one thing<br>
        He told me two<br>
        I am not a girl, and I am not a baby<br>
        I thought, there it is<br>
        The tough-love line we hear from our mothers<br>
        We tell our best friends and we tell our little brothers<br>
        But as often as we say it, it’s still a lie<br>
        Just three words: boys don’t cry<br></p>
        <p>He said, it’s like<br>
        You prove you’re a boy when you prove what you’re not<br>
        Well I got caught a lot so I got taught that you cannot walk like, talk like, fight like, write like, dress like a girl, or you’re less like a boy<br>
        And more like someone who ought to get beat up<br>
        Then he shrugs his shoulders, like I don’t make the rules, but I don’t fuck with fools who don’t know the way to avoid getting called a bitch is to not get emotional in the first place<br>
        It’s the first taste of the pace of the ways we embrace the violence that we think is our best protection<br>
        Like flexing<br>
        I’ll roll up the heart on my sleeve to show you the scar I believe you know where this one is from<br>
        That fight where I fought where I might have not been quite so quick to fit this fist like a fix for that first taste of violence<br>
        But I had to<br>
        There’s too much to lose<br>
        And boys gotta prove what we’re not<br>
        So I’ll bluff like a blackjack callback past the fact that this mask is an act and that’s all it ever was<br>
        And stop talking like I’ve got tears in my eyes<br>
        Cause I’m not a girl and boys don’t…yeah</p>
        <p>He said, there’s one other thing you should understand<br>
        It’s that every young boy wants to be a man<br>
        There’s a presence of lessons in adolescence<br>
        Like when my grade school grad class asked<br>
        What do you want to be when you grow up<br>
        And my only answer was, honestly? Big<br>
        It’s important to recognize, because they don’t just tell you that boys don’t cry<br>
        They say big boys don’t, and then they say you’re big or your worthless<br>
        So I know it’s worth this so I hold this surface tension attention prevention let me be real clear the only thing I’m getting off my chest is a bench press<br>
        What makes a man, muscle<br>
        We’re taught to forget that the heart is a muscle too<br>
        Like I’ll become man enough to withstand enough understand that my hands are commanding enough so I show up with fists so I grow up like this split lip bullshit hit me anywhere you want just don’t acknowledge my feelings<br>
        And when I’m that man I won’t still wonder why<br>
        The first thing I learned is that boys…you get it</p>
        <p>I said, yeah I get it, I’m also a guy<br>
        But listen I’m telling you every boy cries<br>
        It’s a fact, right, but you act, right<br>
        If nothing else wear your mask right<br>
        But it’s like this you start you can’t fight this apart and you gotta let somebody else in your heart, I mean real shit, hard shit<br>
        Trust them and be who you are, quit<br>
        Pretending that this isn’t sad<br>
        Or that it doesn’t matter<br>
        You matter<br>
        That’s not poetry, that’s a full sentence<br>
        So when you say stop it you’re making me cry<br>
        You decide to try to lie to hide deny the inside your implied pride is leading to the biggest killer of boys and young men<br>
        Suicide<br>
        That comes from somewhere<br>
        Which brings me back to that tough love line we heard from our mothers<br>
        We told our best friends and we told our little brothers<br>
        But as often as we said it, it was always a lie<br>
        Let’s change just one word, boys do cry</p>
